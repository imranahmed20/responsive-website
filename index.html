                <p class="about-detail">Right from the start, the World Wide Web was designed to be agnostic. It doesn't matter what hardware you've got.

These days the web is available on desktops, laptops, tablets, foldable phones, fridges, and cars. People rightly expect that websites will look good no matter what device they're using. Responsive design makes this possible.</p>
